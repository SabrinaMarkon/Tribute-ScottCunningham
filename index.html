		<p>Beloved American writer, <strong>Scott Douglas Cunningham</strong>, wrote more than 50 books in his short lifetime, inviting solitary Wiccans and others of alternative faiths to explore, refine, and immerse themselves in their spirituality. As a result, Wicca's beautiful practices and religion were opened up to people who previously would have felt excluded by not being part of a familial tradition. In addition, readers who were previousy unsure how to even begin to appreciate the full spectrum of their faith gained both knowledge and Scott's gentle, accepting perspective to encourage them on their path.</p>
		<p>Scott Cunningham was born in 1956.</p>
